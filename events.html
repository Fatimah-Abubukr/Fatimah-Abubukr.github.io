    <p>Cupcakes are such a delicacy which are fit for any occasion but are perfect for celebrations! Who wouldn't want a delicious cupcake? Personally, I think cupcakes just spice up any event and make it very special. Cupcakes aren't too sweet but not too bland and especially, here at Sweet Delights, we make sure the ratio of sweetness is perfect for everyone!</p>

            <p>Birthdays!!</p>
            <p> Birthdays are a wonderful excuse to have a lovely cupcake. Birthdays are a fabulous time to make someone feel awfully special (so it is a great time for a cupcake). Sometimes a cake can be too big, and sometimes you just want a little treat and a cupcake serves for the correct purpose! It is a time to celebrate, so let's PARTY!! </p>

            <p>Weddings!!</p>
            <p> Weddings are a lovely time to celebrate 2 people becoming one and coming together and a cupcake fits right in for this occasion. You could colour co-ordinate your cupcakes to your theme and that is a perfect way to incorporate a little dessert into your celebration. Although a wedding cake is a must at a wedding, but you can provide small treats of joy for all the guests and keep the costs down. Congratulations!  </p>

            <p> Parties with your friends and families are a great to bond over and spend some lovely time and what better way to spend that time with some cupcakes. The cupcakes act as a lovely snack or desert and fit for all ages! Have a range of different flavours and enjoy!  </p>
